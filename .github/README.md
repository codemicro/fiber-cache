fiber-cache is middleware that provides caching for specific routes in a Fiber application.

### Examples

The most basic caching you can do is like this:

```go
app.Get("/your/route", fcache.New(), yourHandler)
```

This will then cache the response and status code generated by that endpoint for the default TTL (Time-To-Live) specified. You don't have to do anything different in your handler than you normally would. If you have not changed the default TTL value, it is `5 * time.Minute`.

You can change the default TTL for all endpoints by setting `fcache.Config.DefaultTTL` to a `time.Duration`. This will only have an effect on handlers registered after you change the value.

```go
fcache.Config.DefaultTTL = time.Minute * 2
```

You can also set the TTL for each different handler, for example if you want to set one handler to a 20 second TTL while also maintaining the default TTL at 5 minutes.

```go
app.Get("/your/route", fcache.NewWithTTL(fcache.AutoGenerateKey, time.Second*20), yourHandler)
```

Whenever you have the option to set a TTL, you can also set it to have no expiration. The handler function will be called once and the value stored until your program has exited. This can be done using `fcache.NoExpiration`.

```go
app.Get("/your/route", fcache.NewWithTTL(fcache.AutoGenerateKey, fcache.NoExpiration), yourHandler)
```

Internally, caching is done using key-value pairs. Normally, the keys are automatically generated, but you can choose to set them manually if you want.

```go
app.Get("/your/route", fcache.NewWithKey("yourKeyHere"), yourHandler)
```

The cache key for the current route is stored in `c.Locals` as `cacheKey`. This is especially useful if you're using automatically generated keys and want to access the underlying cache engine. This can be done through the `fcache.Cache` variable. [Please click here for information about that.](https://github.com/patrickmn/go-cache)

```go
app.Get("/your/route", fcache.New(), func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
    cacheKey := c.Locals("cacheKey").(string) // -> cacheKey-0
    
    data, found := fcache.Cache.Get(cacheKey)

    // ...

    return c.Send("My cache key is: " + cacheKey) // -> My cache key is: cacheKey-0
})
```

### Limitations

#### 1: headers

Aside from the `Content-Type` header, fiber-cache will not cache headers. If you want a certain header to be added to every response on a specific endpoint, you'll have to add a custom middleware before the cache middleware.

```go
app.Get("/", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
        c.Append("server", "potato")
        return c.Next()
    }, fcache.New(), yourHandler)
```

The `Content-Type` header is the only header that is automatically cached and sent.

#### 2: scope

`fiber-cache` should not be registered as a global middleware (`app.Use(fcache.New())`) as it will cache every endpoint,
including responses from POST and DELETE endpoints while also not running the handler endpoint.

### Reference

[https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/codemicro/fiber-cache/v2](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/codemicro/fiber-cache/v2)

### Installation
You must have Go 1.14 or higher installed before attempting installation.

Installation is done using the `go get` command:

```
go get -u github.com/codemicro/fiber-cache/v2
```

You can then import the package as follows:

```go
import (
    fcache "github.com/codemicro/fiber-cache/v2"
)
```

### Benchmarks

Consider the following example:

```go
app.Get("/", fcache.New(), func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
    time.Sleep(time.Second * 5)
    return c.SendString("Hello world")
})
```
